# Part 1: Introduction to Claude Code

## What is Claude Code?

- Anthropic's official CLI tool for Claude
- Interactive development assistant
- Integrates with your development environment
- Supports file operations, code generation, and more

## Key Features
- üîß Direct file system access
- üåê Web browsing capabilities
- üõ†Ô∏è Tool integration (MCP, Bash)
- üìù Context persistence with CLAUDE.md
- üîÑ Git integration

---

# Part 2: Customizing Your Setup

## The Power of CLAUDE.md Files

### What Goes in CLAUDE.md?

```markdown
# Bash commands
- npm run build: Build the project
- npm run typecheck: Run the typechecker
- npm test: Run the test suite

# Code style
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax
- Destructure imports when possible
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

# Testing
- Always run tests before committing
- Write tests for new features
```

## CLAUDE.md Best Practices

### Repository-Level Context
- Place in project root
- Include project-specific commands
- Document unusual patterns or gotchas

### Global Context
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for personal preferences
- Include commonly used aliases
- Personal coding standards

### Key Information to Include
- ‚úÖ Build commands
- ‚úÖ Test commands
- ‚úÖ Code style guidelines
- ‚úÖ Project structure
- ‚úÖ API keys location (not the keys!)
- ‚úÖ Known issues/workarounds

---

## Managing Tool Permissions

### Four Methods

1. **Interactive Approval**
   - Select "Always allow" when prompted
   - Good for first-time setup

2. **Slash Command**
   ```
   /permissions
   ```
   - Quick runtime configuration

3. **Settings File**
   ```json
   // .claude/settings.json
   {
     "allowedTools": ["Bash:npm install", "Bash:npm run build"]
   }
   ```

4. **CLI Flags**
   ```bash
   claude code --allowedTools "Bash:npm install,Bash:npm run build"
   ```

---

## GitHub Integration

### Setup
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh  # macOS
# or
sudo apt install gh  # Linux

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

### Benefits
- Create pull requests directly
- Manage issues
- Review PR comments
- Access repository information

---

# Part 3: Extending Claude's Capabilities

## Bash Tools Integration

### Documenting Custom Tools

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Custom Tools Available

### transcribe
- Usage: transcribe ./path-to-video.mp4
- Transcribes audio/video files to text

### deploy
- Usage: deploy [staging|production]
- Deploys application to specified environment
```

### Teaching Claude About Tools
1. Tell Claude the tool exists
2. Provide usage examples
3. Suggest running `--help`
4. Document in CLAUDE.md

---

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### What is MCP?
- Protocol for extending Claude's capabilities
- Provides additional tools and resources
- Can be project-specific or global

### Configuration Methods

#### Project Config
```json
// .mcp.json
{
  "servers": {
    "database": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["mcp-server-database/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Global Config
```bash
claude code mcp add /path/to/mcp-server
```

---

## Custom Slash Commands

### Creating Commands

```bash
# Create command file
echo 'Review this code for security vulnerabilities: $ARGUMENTS' \
  > ~/.claude/commands/security-review
```

### Using Commands
```
/security-review auth.js
```

### Best Practices
- Keep templates focused
- Use descriptive names
- Include clear instructions
- Leverage `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder

---

# Part 4: Effective Workflows

## Workflow 1: Explore, Plan, Code, Commit

### 1. Explore
```
"Show me the structure of the authentication module"
"What files handle user registration?"
```

### 2. Plan
```
"Let's think through how to add OAuth support"
/think "Design OAuth integration approach"
```

### 3. Code
```
"Implement Google OAuth login"
"Add tests for the OAuth flow"
```

### 4. Commit
```
"Create a commit with these changes"
"Create a PR for the OAuth feature"
```

---

## Workflow 2: Test-Driven Development

### The TDD Cycle with Claude

1. **Write Tests First**
   ```
   "Write tests for a user authentication service"
   ```

2. **Confirm Tests Fail**
   ```
   "Run the tests to confirm they fail"
   ```

3. **Commit Tests**
   ```
   "Commit the test files"
   ```

4. **Implement Solution**
   ```
   "Now implement the authentication service"
   ```

5. **Verify Tests Pass**
   ```
   "Run the tests again"
   ```

---

## Workflow 3: Visual Design Implementation

### From Mock to Reality

1. **Provide Visual Reference**
   ```
   "Here's a screenshot of the design mock"
   [Paste image]
   ```

2. **Initial Implementation**
   ```
   "Create a React component matching this design"
   ```

3. **Screenshot Result**
   ```
   "Take a screenshot of the current implementation"
   ```

4. **Iterate**
   ```
   "Adjust the spacing and colors to better match"
   ```

---

## Workflow 4: Safe YOLO Mode

### When to Use
- Personal projects
- Isolated environments
- Time-critical debugging

### How to Use
```bash
claude code --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
- Bypasses all safety checks
- Claude can execute any command
- Use with extreme caution
- Never use in production environments

---

# Advanced Tips & Tricks

## 1. Context Management

### Effective Context Usage
- Start conversations with clear goals
- Reference specific files when needed
- Use CLAUDE.md for persistent context
- Clear context when switching tasks

## 2. Performance Optimization

### Speed Up Your Workflow
- Batch related requests
- Use specific file paths
- Leverage search before editing
- Keep CLAUDE.md concise

---

## 3. Debugging Strategies

### Working with Claude on Bugs

1. **Provide Error Context**
   ```
   "Here's the error I'm getting: [error message]"
   ```

2. **Include Stack Traces**
   ```
   "The full stack trace is: ..."
   ```

3. **Specify Environment**
   ```
   "This happens in production but not local"
   ```

4. **Request Systematic Approach**
   ```
   "Let's debug this step by step"
   ```

---

## 4. Code Review Process

### Getting Quality Reviews

```
"Review this code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Best practices
- Test coverage
- Documentation needs"
```

### Iterative Improvement
1. Initial implementation
2. Request review
3. Apply suggestions
4. Re-review if needed

# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

## 1. Over-Permissioning
‚ùå Allowing all bash commands globally
‚úÖ Whitelist specific safe commands

## 2. Insufficient Context
‚ùå "Fix the bug"
‚úÖ "Fix the authentication bug in login.js line 42"

## 3. Ignoring Conventions
‚ùå Letting Claude guess coding style
‚úÖ Document style in CLAUDE.md

## 4. Skipping Tests
‚ùå Committing without testing
‚úÖ Always run tests before commits

---
